# GoCommerce
A simple application for order listing and filtering using Go Fiber, Vue.js, PostgreSQL &amp; Python.

## Technologies
#### Go Fiber
Fiber is a Go web framework built on top of Fasthttp, the fastest HTTP engine for Go. It's designed to ease things up for fast development with zero memory allocation and performance in mind.

#### Vue.js
Vue is a progressive JavaScript framework that provides a declarative and component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces, be they simple or complex.

#### PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is an object relational database management system which is a system used for managing data in relations, or tables which are grouped into databases, so you can have multiple tables in one database.

#### Docker
Docker is a platform for developers to develop, deploy, and run applications with containers since containers are portable, lightweight and stackable.

## Project Description
In this project, REST APIs are developed in Go Fiber framework and is integrated with PostgreSQL along with its migration scripts. Frontend is made of Vue. 5 excel sheets are imported into the application and a DB relation is also set up by using Python scripts.
